CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilty Exposure, is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, they mean a security flaw that's been assigned a CVE ID number.

ERRRor CHALLENGE.

This challenge mocked us with error hint meaning that our flag might have beeen on the error. I used the payload ```' or 1=1-- - ``` and then error with flag poped up but it wasn't a real flag so i tried another method which is ``` ' 1 or 1=1-- -``` and i was succefully bypassed the login page.

After loging in this was **Flag**

So this was error based sql injection but on instruction  challenge but it was written as login challenge.
I used the payload ``` ' or 1=1-- -``` and i got the pop-up which had a flag.

**Flag is located on the right hand side of the web page**

BRUTEFORCE CHALLENGE

Since the question says about ```admin``` then thats a user of the web page.
I used burp suite to solve the challenge and letter on i used interesting tool called hydra.

:::info
 **Burp suit.**
:::

**I will show some few steps here because i believe you are able to start,capture,intercept on burpsuite.**

**Login page to brute froce.**

**Capture request from the web page and sent it to intruder.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/4Qm0peR.png)


**Clear all unnecessary and leave only required parts, for our case we need to bruteforce password field.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/E7WvzaR.png)

**Load the password file and start the attack.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/htZnLv2.png)

**Once it finishes, filter with a common error. In our case the common error for all unsuccessful login was** ```LOGIN FAILED```

![](https://i.imgur.com/YUB9nC5.png)

**Select Negative search to allow burp to filter pages and return those with no ```LOGIN FAILED``` Error message.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/7bhUoen.png)

**By doing so we get request number 501 has what we need and the passowrd is** ```chocolatelimao```

SQL LOGIC CHALLENGE.
--
![](https://i.imgur.com/HcXV2uk.png)

This question aimed to challenge users understanding on basic concept of the UNION based SQL injection. As the question stated itself there was an injection in the age field and database had 5 columns.
I used some of internet resources and  came to realise that, inorder to read files on SQL, then LOAD_FILE() function is used. For more information you can visit [VK9Security](https://vk9-sec.com/advanced-sql-injection-union-based/) or you can download this [pdf](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjE86eV86z3AhWbQkEAHYqNC4sQFnoECA8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackhat.com%2Fpresentations%2Fbh-europe-09%2FGuimaraes%2FBlackhat-europe-09-Damele-SQLInjection-slides.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0ke74DnHmvESOU8jgz3ygC).
On our question the important thing was to know where injection is, and it is in 3rd column named as ```age```.
Then required format was ```UDOM{'UNIONSELECT1,2,LOADFILE("/tmp/security.txt"),4,5;---}```

:::info
Note: Before UNION there is **'** then inorder to avoid error then use **""** where you want to read.

COMMAND 1 CHALLENGE.

![](https://i.imgur.com/DNVVlxn.png)

If you know command injection then this was simple task all you had was to think out of the box. Question says ping or whois i don't know meaning you can execute more than one command by using **==```;```==** then i decided to use whois command.
```whois -h 129.80.41.223:8890; ls -l;``` and it output the following:


![](https://i.imgur.com/6VXkSlZ.png)

This was good start and as long as the question says get /flag then this must be stored in root directory and file named flag, so i decided to use another command.
```whois -h 129.80.41.223:8890; cat /flag;``` then i was able to see the flag
